"ONE" TIME SERIES FORECASTING
BACKTESTING

Forecasting using the tensorflow library, using a proprietary AI model.
This model - is an attempt to build a model in the case where it is possible to use only a very small amount of data, i.e. a short time series containing up to 1000 rows.

This repository presents an unusual way to use AI results.
For this purpose, the BOLLINGER BANDS of AI results were used to search for local extremes, which are supposed to indicate an increased probability of a trend correction.

This model does not constitute financial advice under any international regulations on financial markets.
